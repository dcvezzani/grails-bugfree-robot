== Learning Grails from a Rails perspective

I love Ruby and I am quite fond of Rails.  I am learning that Grails is a more distant cousin of Rails than I originally thought.  I am struggling to understand what seems to be some of the most simplest of concepts,... like creating the equivalent of migrations, applying them and running my web app successfully.

I plan on documenting a thing or two regarding Grails and how to best work with it.
